## The Diamond Dilemma üíé

The project was inspired by a newspaper ad promoting natural diamonds (NDs), comparing them to luxury items like **wine**, **Banarsi sarees**, and the **Taj Mahal**. This sparked curiosity about the reasons behind such advertising and the market dynamics of diamonds. Web scraping was performed on YouTube comments to analyze consumer sentiment, followed by sentiment analysis to assess public opinions. Additionally, pricing data was gathered from jewelry companies selling both NDs and lab-grown diamonds (LGDs). The results provided key insights into consumer preferences and the price gap between the two types.

### ‚≠êAssumptions
- For simplicity, the term "diamond" is used throughout the project to represent natural diamonds (NDs). This was done to avoid confusion and keep the analysis straightforward.

- The sentiment analysis was conducted using VADER, but there were instances where the model could not accurately detect sentiment. This occurred particularly with ambiguous or context-specific comments where the sentiment wasn‚Äôt explicitly clear (e.g., sarcastic comments).

- This project was created primarily for learning purposes. As such, certain aspects, such as data collection and analysis, were intentionally kept simple to ensure focus on core concepts and methods, without diving too deeply into the complexities of market dynamics.

- The pricing data was manually collected from jewelry websites, without considering factors like seasonal pricing trends or regional variations. While many external factors could affect diamond prices, such as quality, size, or market fluctuations, these were not the primary focus of this project. The goal was to establish a general comparison between NDs and LGDs rather than explore all potential influencing variables.

### ‚≠êKey Insights

1. Market Perception of Diamonds: More negative sentiment towards NDs than positive, with advertising efforts trying to improve perceptions.
2. Demand Decrease for NDs: The demand drop in the US and China is due to the economic crisis in the US and resale value issues in China, where consumers have shifted to more fungible assets like gold since COVID-19.
3. Price Differences: NDs and LGDs show minimal price differences in the low-end market, but LGDs are more affordable in the high-end market, particularly for rings and pendants. NDs still hold a premium for earrings.
